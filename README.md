## Desing

- **Typography**
- Google Fonts was used for the following font:
- Playpen Sans, cursive for the body

- **Colour**
- I have used colors that match and children usually likes.
- And colors that are easy for the eye to catch.
- I have worked with Purple, Blue, White and Black.

## Testing
- I have tested the game on diffrent devices. My sister and my wife has also tried it on their own mobile devices.
- The game always works.
- The header, the pictures, the result and the audiofile works and it is readable.
