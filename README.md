# Space Memory

Space Memory is a memory game for children. It is a simple game with simple instructions. On the first page, the player gets to know the rules and enters the game with just one click of a button.

## Existing Features

- **Header**
- The game has a header at the top of the home-page . It shows a welcome text and the name of the game. The large letters and sharp colors make it easy to see and read the text.

- When the player finds a match, the matching cards stay face up and the game can continue.

- When the player has found all matching cards, the result comes.
- The result tells the player how many points it has managed to get.
- Inside the result box is a button that asks the player if they want to play again.
- If the player presses it, the images are shuffled, the score counter goes down to zero and the game can start again

## Desing

- **Typography**
- Google Fonts was used for the following font:
- Playpen Sans, cursive for the body

- **Colour**
- I have used colors that match and children usually likes.
- And colors that are easy for the eye to catch.
- I have worked with Purple, Blue, White and Black.

## Testing

- I have tested the game on diffrent devices. My sister and my wife has also tried it on their own mobile devices.
- The game always works.
- The header, the pictures, the result and the audiofile works and it is readable.

### Lighthouse

- I used Lighthouse within the Chrome Developer Tools to test performance, accesibility, best practices and SEO of the website for both desktop and mobile.
